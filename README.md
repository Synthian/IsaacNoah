# Cadaver: The Rotten Expansion
Cadaver is a mod for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance that adds 11 new unlocks and 1 new playable character (tainted version included)! Explore the basement with Cadaver, Isaac's rotting corpse, and gain access to Golden Souls, Rotten Chests, and more!

## Cadaver
***Base Stats***  
Damage: 6.36  
Fire Rate: 1.5  
Max Health: 0 (+ 1 Bone Heart filled with a Rotten Heart)  
*All other stats are the same as Isaac.*  

***Starting Item***   
Yuck Heart   

***Passives***
* Cadaver only has one rotten eye, so he can only fire at a **fixed 1.5 tears per second**. Those tears are nasty though! All **tear pickups are converted to an equivalent damage multiplier.** Cadaver keeps the same DPS as normal Isaac, but with all of the stats weighted towards Damage.
* Cadaver can **only obtain Rotten Hearts and Bone Hearts.** He can still obtain heart containers, but they must be filled with Rotten Hearts. 
* Items that heal Cadaver or give maximum HP will instead give Rotten Hearts.
* Any **red hearts that spawn are converted** to Rotten Hearts, with a rare chance to convert into a Bone Heart.
* Cadaver **can pickup soul hearts, but they are immediately removed to spawn friendly critters**! You made friends in the grave, after all.
* Blue flies, poison, and some similar effects do *reduced* damage. This is due to a bug in Isaac, but Cadaver is balanced around it.

***Birthright***  
*Better friends*  
When Cadaver has Birthright, all current and future **blue flies are converted into random Locusts.**  

## Tainted Cadaver
***Base Stats***  
Damage: 1.15  
Fire Rate: 5.0  
Max Health: 0 (+ 2 Bone Hearts filled with a Rotten Heart)  
*All other stats are the same as Isaac.*  

***Starting Item***   
Halitosis (see details below)   

***Stat Passives***
* Tainted Cadaver fires at a **fixed 5.0 tears per second.** All **tear pickups are converted to an equivalent damage multiplier.**
* Tainted Cadaver has **40% reduced damage.**
* Tainted Cadaver can **only obtain Bone Hearts and fill them with Rotten Hearts.**
* Tainted Cadaver can only have a **maximum of four bone hearts.**
* Items that heal Tainted Cadaver or give maximum HP will instead give Bone + Rotten Hearts.
* Any **red hearts that spawn are converted** to Rotten Hearts, with a small chance to convert into a Bone Heart.
* Poison, blue spiders, and some similar effects do *increased* damage. This is due to a bug in Isaac, but Tainted Cadaver is balanced around it.

***Friendly Critters***
* Tainted Cadaver **can pickup soul hearts, but they are immediately removed to spawn friendly critters**!
* Tainted Cadaver's friendly **critters are permanent and deal 3.0 damage**
* Using **Halitosis will respawn any dead critters** and will relocate all alive critters to Tainted Cadaver's location.
* If Tainted Cadaver has BFFS!, critters will do 4.5 damage.

***Birthright***  
*Respawning friends*  
When Tainted Cadaver has Birthright, his **friendly units automatically respawn after 3 seconds.**

### Halitosis [Treasure Room]

If Isaac has Car Battery, Halitosis fires 12 tears over 2 seconds.  

### Morgue Key [Secret Room]

### Tech Drones [Treasure Room]
*Defeat Mother as Tainted Cadaver*  
Gain two familiar robots that orbit Isaac at a large distance.  
When Isaac fires tears, a laser connects the two bots, dealing 40% of Isaac's tear damage per tick.  
  
If Isaac has BFFS!, the laser does 60% of Isaac's tear damage.  
If Isaac uses Box of Friends, the bots are duplicated temporarily.  

### Hydrochloric Acid [Treasure Room]
*Defeat Beast as Tainted Cadaver*  
After hitting an enemy 5 times, all future attacks will deal an additional 3.0 flat damage.  
Synergizes well with Brimstone, Technology, and other weapons that have a high tick rate.  

## Multiplayer Interactions
* Item unlock progression is only tracked if Player 1 is Cadaver/Tainted Cadaver.
* Morgue Key will only remember items held by Player 1
* Heart conversions to Rotten + Bone hearts are only done if Player 1 is Cadaver/Tainted Cadaver.
* Multiple Tainted Cadavers share one army that respawns when any Tainted Cadaver uses Halitosis.
* All other interactions should now work as would be expected, but limited testing has been done.

## Known Issues
* Completion marks do not display on the main menu, even though they are being tracked. There are other mods to add completion marks to modded characters.
* Several effects ignore item unlocks. For instance, you can obtain bone hearts before unlocking them.
* Achievements show up immediately upon a boss dying, rather than after the run has completed / in between stages.
